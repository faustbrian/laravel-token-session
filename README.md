# Laravel Token Session

I would appreciate you taking the time to look at my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/faustbrian) and considering to support me if I'm saving you some time with my work.

## Installation

Require this package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), in the root directory of your project.

``` bash
$ composer require faustbrian/laravel-token-session
```

And then, if using Laravel 5, include the service provider within `app/config/app.php`.

``` php
BrianFaust\TokenSession\TokenSessionServiceProvider::class

And, for convenience, add a facade alias to this same file at the bottom:

``` php
'TokenSession' => BrianFaust\TokenSession\Facades\TokenSession
```

## Usage
